## [2.1.1] - 2024-10-08

### Fixed

- Removed the default value for `server.servlet.session.cookie.max-age`, which was causing sessions to time out twenty minutes after login instead of after twenty minutes of inactivity. (AUTHLIB-151)

## [2.1.0] - 2024-10-03

### Added

- Added the ability to configure the user form's role selection UI, enabling applications to choose an input type that fits their permission model (radio buttons, checkboxes, or something custom). For backward compatibility with existing applications, this defaults to rendering a checkbox for each role. See [docs/USER_ROLE_CONFIGURATION.md](docs/USER_ROLE_CONFIGURATION.md) for details. (AUTHLIB-138)

### Fixed

- There is now front end validation to ensure that users have at least one role. (AUTHLIB-60)

## [2.0.0] - 2024-09-11

### Added

- Added the [`UserManagementCustomizer`](authentication_lib/src/main/java/org/octri/authentication/server/customizer/UserManagementCustomizer.java) interface, which provides hooks to modify behavior when user accounts are created or updated. See [docs/USER_MANAGEMENT_CUSTOMIZATION.md](./docs/USER_MANAGEMENT_CUSTOMIZATION.md) for details. (AUTHLIB-136)
- **Breaking**: Added a required property to the `User` entity that explicitly identifies the method used to authenticate the user. Consuming applications must add [a migration to add the field and backfill data for existing accounts](setup/migrations/V20240910090000__add_user_auth_type.sql). (AUTHLIB-73)

### Changed

- **Breaking**: Removed requirement for institution field on User. Consuming apps must add [a migration to remove the constraint](setup/migrations/V20240731121000__alter_user_optional_institution.sql) since the form will no longer validate. (AUTHLIB-57)
- **Breaking**: The following UserService methods have been moved to [`EmailNotificationService`](authentication_lib/src/main/java/org/octri/authentication/server/security/service/EmailNotificationService.java) and the method signature changed: sendPasswordResetTokenEmail, sendPasswordResetEmailConfirmation. For both methods, the dryRun parameter has been removed and replaced with the configuration property octri.authentication.email-dry-run.
- **Breaking**: Support for the Spring profile 'noemail' was removed and replaced with the configuration property octri.authentication.email-required. Applications relying on the profile should update their configuration accordingly.
- **Breaking**: The interface of `UserController` has changed to return `ModelAndView` objects instead of strings. This will break applications that extend this class. Applications that rely on extending `UserController` should update the affected methods to return a `ModelAndView` or implement a [`UserManagementCustomizer`](authentication_lib/src/main/java/org/octri/authentication/server/customizer/UserManagementCustomizer.java) instead. (AUTHLIB-136)
- Logic for the default user management workflow has been extracted from `UserController.java` and moved to the [`DefaultUserManagementCustomizer`](authentication_lib/src/main/java/org/octri/authentication/server/customizer/DefaultUserManagementCustomizer.java) class. See [docs/USER_MANAGEMENT_CUSTOMIZATION.md](docs/USER_MANAGEMENT_CUSTOMIZATION.md) for details. (AUTHLIB-136)
- **Breaking**: The user controller has been refactored to separate the logic for creating new users from the logic used to update existing users, with different URLs. Applications should update their templates to reflect the new URLs. The new user form has been relocated to `{{req.contextPath}}/admin/user/new`, and the edit form has been relocated to `{{req.contextPath}}/admin/user/{{id}}`. (AUTHLIB-146)
- **Breaking**: Support for Bootstrap 4 has been dropped. Applications should upgrade to`authentication_ui_bootstrap5` and update their templates for Bootstrap 5 or [override all of the AuthLib templates](docs/CONFIGURATION_PROPERTIES.md#template-configuration). (AUTHLIB-135)
- **Breaking**: Dropped redundant boolean flags for account and credential expiration from the user entity. Consuming applications must add [a migration to drop the columns and reconcile expiration dates](setup/migrations/V20240904110000__drop_redundant_user_metadata.sql). (AUTHLIB-143)

### Removed

- **Breaking**: The `PasswordResetToken` convenience constructors have been removed. Applications should construct a token and set its properties explicitly or use one of the methods in [`PasswordResetTokenService`](authentication_lib/src/main/java/org/octri/authentication/server/security/service/PasswordResetTokenService.java) to construct tokens instead.
- **Breaking**: The two-argument version of `PasswordResetTokenService.generatePasswordResetToken` that passes the token duration as an integer has been removed. Applications should use one of the other convenience methods of [`PasswordResetTokenService`](authentication_lib/src/main/java/org/octri/authentication/server/security/service/PasswordResetTokenService.java) to construct tokens instead.
- **Breaking**: The deprecated `User` convenience constructor has been removed. Applications should construct a User and set its properties explicitly.
- **Breaking**: Deprecated `User` entity methods have been removed. For a similar interface, use an instance of `AuthenticationUserDetails` instead.
  - `isAccountNonLocked`
  - `getAccountNonLocked`
  - `setAccountNonLocked`
  - `isAccountNonExpired`
  - `getAccountNonExpired`
  - `setAccountNonExpired`
  - `isCredentialsNonExpired`
  - `isCredentialsExpired`
  - `getCredentialsNonExpired`
  - `setCredentialsNonExpired`
- **Breaking**: The `UserService` method `sendNotificationEmail` has been removed. Applications should send their own notifications for use cases that aren't fully supported by this library.
- **Breaking**: The `UserService` method `isLdapUser` has been removed. The methods `User.isLdapUser` or `User.getLdapUser` can be used to reliably determine whether the user authenticates with LDAP.

## [1.3.0] - 2024-09-11

### Deprecated

The following methods have been deprecated and will be removed in version 2.0.0.

- The `User` convenience constructor is deprecated. Applications should construct a User and set its properties explicitly.
- The `UserService` method `sendNotificationEmail` is deprecated. Applications should send their own notifications for use cases that aren't fully supported by this library.
- The `UserService` method `isLdapUser` is deprecated. As of version 2.0.0, whether a user authenticates using LDAP can be determined reliably using methods of the `User` entity directly.

## [1.2.0] - 2024-07-25

### Added

- Added a configuration property that controls how long password reset tokens are valid, `octri.authentication.password-token-valid-for`. The property defaults to 30 minutes to preserve the behavior of existing applications. See [`CONFIGURATION_PROPERTIES.md`](docs/CONFIGURATION_PROPERTIES.md) for valid values. (AUTHLIB-119)

### Deprecated

The following methods have been deprecated and will be removed in version 2.0.0.

- The `PasswordResetToken` convenience constructors are deprecated. Applications should construct a token and set its properties explicitly or use one of the methods in [`PasswordResetTokenService`](authentication_lib/src/main/java/org/octri/authentication/server/security/service/PasswordResetTokenService.java) to construct tokens instead.
- The two-argument version of `PasswordResetTokenService.generatePasswordResetToken` that passes the token duration as an integer number of minutes is deprecated. Applications should use one of the other convenience methods of [`PasswordResetTokenService`](authentication_lib/src/main/java/org/octri/authentication/server/security/service/PasswordResetTokenService.java) to construct tokens instead.

## [1.1.0] - 2024-07-11

### Added

- Add a custom `RequestRejectedHandler` implementation that returns an error response without throwing an exception. To use this implementation in your application, add a `@Bean` method that returns an instance of `LoggingRequestRejectedHandler`. (CIS-2703)

- Allow using email addresses as usernames. To avoid breaking changes, this is disabled by default. See [UPGRADING.md](./UPGRADING.md) for details on how to enable this feature. (AUTHLIB-134)

## [1.0.1] - 2024-04-18

### Fixed

- Correct session cookie properties (`server.session.cookie.*` -> `server.servlet.session.cookie.*`). To prevent making a breaking change, the default property values are unchanged. (AUTHLIB-129) For most applications, you should consider adopting the following secure values:

  ```properties
  server.servlet.session.cookie.http-only=true
  server.servlet.session.cookie.same-site=strict
  server.servlet.session.cookie.secure=true
  ```

## [1.0.0] - 2024-01-11

### Changed

- **Breaking**: Upgrade to Spring Boot 3.2 and Java 17. Consuming apps will also need to upgrade their Spring Boot and Java versions. (AUTHLIB-124)
- **Breaking**: Remove `@EnableJpaAuditing` annotation from `DefaultSecurityConfigurer`. This eliminates the need to set `spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true` in every consuming app, but it requires consuming apps to set `@EnableJpaAuditing`. (AUTHLIB-122)

### Fixed

- Implement `Serializable` in `AbstractEntity` to fix warnings when applications reference the `User` entity (AUTHLIB-120)

### Removed

- Remove unused, long-deprecated `isValidResetToken` method from the `PasswordResetTokenService`. This was replaced by the `isExpired` method of the `PasswordResetToken` entity.
- Remove unused three-argument version of the `sendPasswordResetTokenEmail` method from the `UserService`. This was only ever used by SHIFT, and was replaced by the four-argument version.
